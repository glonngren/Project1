  <h2>Our Lady of Angels Mission</h2>
  <p>
    I am currently involved in a project that will see a new WiFi network installed
    into a building that is under renovation and is to serve as a food pantry, retreat center,
    volunteer living space and resource center for local families in Humbolt Park.
    Currently we are raising funds to purchase required equipment. If you would like to
    participate in this project or donate to the cause, please visit the following link
    for more information. <li id="nav-donate"><a href="www.ola-online.com">IT Project</a></li>
